# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
This is a back-end project that focuses on creating a server for the WTWR application. Two collections of data are created to work with inside a database. The project uses schemas, controllers, and routes to establish item requirements and direct them to the database. It also employs validation and error handling to insure that user entered data is valid and the correct server response is communicated if not. Security and testing is established and web applications are deployed on a remote machine. The goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
